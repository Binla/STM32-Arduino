# STM32-Arduino
---

Arduino board package origin files for the STM32 MCU based target boards, including the RedBear Duo. There are many examples included in the board package under **"arduino/libraries/RedBear_Duo/examples"**. Any contributions to this repository are really appreciated.

Any features, enhancements and bugfixes to the board package has been documented in this [Changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

For users only want to playing with the boards need not to clone or download this repository, since the Arduino IDE has provided an easy way (known as **Boards Manager**) for you to install the board package. See the step-by-step [Arduino Board Package Installation Guide](https://github.com/redbear/Duo/blob/master/docs/arduino_board_package_installation_guide.md).

To get started with the boards supported in this board package on Arduino IDE, Please follow the [Getting Started](https://github.com/redbear/Duo/blob/master/docs/getting_started_with_arduino_ide.md) guide.

Other documentations and resources for the RedBear Duo can be found [here](https://github.com/redbear/Duo).
